In this Tutorial section we’ll talk about a key strategic object in your room: Room Controller. By controlling this invincible structure you can build facilities in the room. The higher the controller level, the more structures available to build.

Perfect, you have upgraded your Controller level!

Important: If you don’t upgrade your Controller within 20,000 game ticks, it loses one level. On reaching level 0, you will lose control over the room, and another player will be able to capture it freely. Make sure that at least one of your creeps regularly performs the function upgradeController.
